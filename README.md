# PKM Canon

PKM Canon converts source exports into independently validated, portable
canonical packages. The package is PKM Canon's authoritative ingestion result;
search, inference, review outputs, and Markdown pages are derived products.

The repo-owned [current architecture](docs/architecture/current-state.md),
[target architecture](docs/architecture/target-state.md), and
[component map](docs/architecture/component-map.md) show implemented and
proposed components, their code and checks, and the next Linear work. Run
`node scripts/check-architecture.mjs` to check diagram IDs and local links.

The current implementation has two source adapters: Roam JSON and one
repository Markdown file. Both produce source-version capture, structured
content, preservation artifacts, fidelity diagnostics, and a manifest with
file hashes and counts. The Roam product proposes methodology rules from
attributes. The Markdown product proposes explicit ownership claims. Neither
proposal becomes active without a review event.

## Quick start

Use the repository's Python environment and committed lockfile:

```sh
uv sync --extra dev --locked
source .venv/bin/activate
make check
pkmcanon ingest-roam graph.json my-graph output/roam-package
pkmcanon validate output/roam-package
pkmcanon audit-fidelity output/roam-package --top 20
pkmcanon ingest-markdown docs/context-api.md platform output/markdown-package --source-path docs/context-api.md
```

The `pkmcanon` command is installed into `.venv/bin`. Use that explicit path
when the virtual environment is not activated.
For a private source, pass the intended reviewer identity with
`ingest-roam --principal REVIEWER_ID` (or `ingest-markdown --principal`), then
use the same ID with `propose-methodology --principal` and in the review policy.
The default `local-operator` identity is for local demonstrations.

## Reviewable product flow

```sh
pkmcanon propose-methodology output/roam-package output/methodology-proposals.jsonl
pkmcanon render-methodology-review output/roam-package output/methodology-proposals.jsonl output/methodology-review.html
pkmcanon propose-domain-claims output/markdown-package output/domain-proposals.jsonl
```

Each proposal file contains stable IDs, a typed payload, exact evidence
references, and a source-package ID. The review HTML ranks draft rules by a
support heuristic and shows a few escaped citation previews. The command does not
upload it or record decisions. The file contains source excerpts; keep the
output private and inspect full evidence before review. Methodology statements
identify their Roam graph scope. The queue shows distinct-page, blank/template,
key-variant, and co-occurrence counts and places weak candidates after those
ready for review. The heuristic is not a probability.
Record an approval or rejection with:

```sh
pkmcanon review PACKAGE PROPOSALS PROPOSAL_ID POLICY_JSON REVIEW_LEDGER REVIEWER_ID approved
pkmcanon render-methodology-review PACKAGE PROPOSALS output/methodology-review.html --ledger REVIEW_LEDGER --policy POLICY_JSON
```

`examples/local-review-policy.json` is a local demonstration policy.
Production deployments must supply their own authorized reviewer policy.
Publication reads the append-only review ledger and selects approved
proposals only:

```sh
pkmcanon publish-methodology PACKAGE PROPOSALS REVIEW_LEDGER POLICY_JSON output/active-methodology.json
pkmcanon publish-domain-page PACKAGE PROPOSALS REVIEW_LEDGER POLICY_JSON output/reviewed-domain.md
```

`pkmcanon context PACKAGE "owner" ownership` assembles an access-aware
lexical evidence bundle from the package. The lexical implementation is a
small local projection. `pkmcanon build-index PACKAGE output/index.json`
creates a rebuildable lexical and native-link index; pass
`--index output/index.json` to `pkmcanon context` to use it. Hybrid retrieval
and cross-source resolution remain future work.

`pkmcanon project-shared PACKAGE output/content-snapshot.json` exports the
source-neutral content contract. `pkmcanon project-markdown PACKAGE
output/audit-pages` creates an audit-oriented Markdown projection and
evidence sidecars; it is not a round-trip migration adapter.

## Local ingestion jobs

The local API accepts a bounded source upload and returns `202` with a stable
job ID. A separate worker validates and commits its package; job state is
stored in SQLite so the worker can resume after interruption. Start the API
on loopback and process queued jobs with:

```sh
pkmcanon serve-jobs output/jobs --port 8775
pkmcanon work-jobs output/jobs
```

Upload with `POST /api/v1/ingest/roam?source_scope=graph&native_id=export.json`
or `/api/v1/ingest/markdown?source_scope=repo&native_id=docs/page.md`, sending
the source file as the raw request body. Poll `GET /api/v1/ingest/jobs/{job_id}`; a completed job
names its validated package. The API has no authentication and is intended for
local development on `127.0.0.1`. An external deployment needs an authenticated
transport and worker supervision.

Labeled retrieval cases use the `evaluation-case` schema and name expected
canonical node IDs. Run `pkmcanon evaluate PACKAGE INDEX CASES RESULTS
PROPOSALS` to measure recall and abstention. Missed, accessible gold evidence
becomes a typed retrieval-change proposal for review; the evaluator never
silently changes the index or source model.

## Contracts and scope

- Runtime records live in `src/pkmcanon/models.py`. Committed JSON Schemas
  are generated under `docs/specs/schemas/`; `make check` fails on drift.
- Source identity and known losses are specified in
  `docs/specs/source-profiles/`. Each package retains the original source
  bytes and records its hash.
- The product rename changes emitted schema and facet URNs. Parser versions
  change with that output, so new packages have distinct immutable package IDs
  even when their source bytes are unchanged. Existing local packages are not
  rewritten; use a new output directory to generate a package under the new
  namespace and retain older packages for historical audit.
- The validated package is committed atomically through the product-neutral
  `CanonStore[Ref, Commit, Artifact]` port. PKM Canon binds it as
  `CanonicalStore = CanonStore[Path, PackageCommit, CanonicalPackage]` and
  provides a filesystem implementation. No database or hosted service is
  needed to validate a package.
- The V1 design and implementation plan under `docs/specs/` describe later
  API, PostgreSQL, retrieval, inference, and export work. Those sections are
  proposals, not claims that the features are already implemented.

## Review guidance

[Repo reviewer guidance](docs/reviewing.md) references the shared
[Canonworks reviewer standards draft](https://app.notion.com/p/3ef899c28af3810dac04e9cac557d530) and records local applicability
and supported checks. Common wording is maintained in Notion.
